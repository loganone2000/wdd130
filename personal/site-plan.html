      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This page will have information regaring the purpose of this website and an introduction to me. People will come to this site to read about my technical experience and knowledge that come from 30 years of experience. They will be interested in my exposure to machines and batteries from multiple aspects of the power quality industry. There will be a list of some of the manufactures that I have been exposed to. There will also be information regarding the training I have received.
        The questions answered by this page may deal with where I have seen various machines. I will try to answer that without revealing the specific customer information. There will also be questions about access gained to some site. Unfortunately, that information cannot be shared in this context.

      <h3>Equipment</h3>
      <p>
        Over the years I have had to use many tools. Many of the tools are industry standards. Everyone is familiar with the Fluke name and the items they offer. The Fluke 87 line of meters has been a go to for many years. The Fluke 8060A, a meter from the 1980â€™s, still finds a place in my tool bag. The extra digit and higher accuracy make it nice to use for telecommunications jobs. One amp clamp that I use is the 80i-600. This too is no longer offered, but I find the smaller size and repairable cable makes it one that I find very useful.
Over the years I have had a few oscilloscopes. The first one was a Tektronix oscilloscope that you plugged into the wall. The ground lug was removed from the power cord as this unit was used to measure the output of inverters. That was replaced by a battery powered unit. I am now on my fourth oscilloscope, this one a Fluke, that is in color with four channels. This one does the power quality measurements that allow me to analyze the power being produced by a machine.
In test units, we sometimes had to load test batteries and systems. There was the standard auto store type of load tester for batteries. As time progressed the need to test multiple batteries at the same time became necessary. I bought some elements, and with parts left over from older equipment, I made DC load banks for specific requirements. Of course, technology made those obsolete and the load banks that we use now are industry standard types that are used for DC systems. 
Another advance from technology is the way we test batteries now. In days past we would use a multimeter to measure the battery voltage, and a micro-ohm meter to measure the link resistance. We then would have to right down the readings, type them into a data base, print out the results, and mail the results to the customer. Now we use a piece of equipment that measures and record these results and allows you to download them to be saved into a computer. You can now create the reports and send them to customers electronically. All advantages of new technologies. 
The tools of the trade have evolved with times. I look forward to working with what comes next.

      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <p>
        For over thirty years I have worked with this company as a field service technician. During that time, I have experienced many different situations and difficulties. With teamwork and training I have met these challenges successfully. Using provided tools and training I have been able to service a multitude of equipment and customers. 
I have been to several training classes from different manufacturers. Some of which are no longer in business and others have been bought out by competitors. For example, Johnson Controls had a line of batteries and a site in Pennsylvania. They were bought out by C&D.  When they did exist, I attended the one class they offered on batteries. It was a brief class which also included a tour of the facility.
Another manufacture was PECO. They had a line of rectifiers that were used mostly in the telecommunications industry. With technology changing so rapidly, their bulky designs were eventually replaced with smaller more efficient systems. I worked on those products for a few years before they went out of business.
Other manufacturers seem to grow with technology and make changes in their lines as they found new ways to do the same thing. Companies like Mitsubishi continue to evolve with smaller machines still making the power customers are asking for. Another company, APC was bought out by Schneider Electric and they continue to make improvements as well.
Here is a list of companies that I have attended training classes with. Keep in mind that most offer different pieces of equipment.
APC (Schneider Electric)
MGE (Schneider Electric)
Mitsubishi
PECO
JCI Battery
GE
Hubbell 
United Power

There are others that I have been taught inhouse and in the field:

Exide/Powerware now Eaton
Emerson/Liebert now Vertiv
Best bought out by Powerware
C&D DC systems
Chloride
Topaz
Online Power
Toshiba
SBS
LaMarche
Eltek Valere
Myers Power Products

At times there have been a need to go out to see a machine that we have never seen before. With very little notice I have been sent out into the field to see these machines with only the name and model number.  This is what it means to be a field service technician.
