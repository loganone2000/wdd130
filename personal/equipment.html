            <p>In the course of my career I have used many tools to perform my job function. 
            For example, there is the oscilloscope. As technology has advanced, so has this device.
        From the standard analog benchtop model that we lugged around to each site to the digital
    devices we now use, these have been invaluable in testing system operation.They certainly make my job easire</p> 

                <p>The multimeters I have used have not changed that much. The Fluke 87 series
                    of meters have increased in accuracy and capabilities and have been the mainstay
                    for field service. I still use and old Fluke 8060A for rectifier systems due to
                    the extra digit and higher accuracy. Sometimes new is not exactly better.

            <h2>Tools of the trade</h2>
    <p class="rapids">
        <p>In the past there were tools that we needed that were not commecially available. Some such tools
            were load banks. For testing certain machines or batteries, specific voltages and currents were
            needed to correctly test them. In those instances we actually made our own load testing equipment.
            For one series of DC load tester, I calculated the required load, and then I ordered
            a length of nichrome wire. Using materials left over from retired equipment I made a load bank. 
            I made four of those.
        </p> 

            <p>Perhaps the greatest tool I had was the training I recieved. For the first three years 
                working for this company,I spend that time working primarily on batteries. There was one training 
                class at a battery manufacturer, but most of my education came from fellow workers. With challenges 
                found in the field, I am able to share what I know with others as they have shared with me.
            </p>
            <p>While working during the day, I was also teaching industrial electronic at night. If anything
                this experience increased my technical abilities. I was frequently challenged with questions from 
                students and changes in textbooks. I gained better perspective on education having been on both sides 
                of the class. As part of my teaching duties I had to revise and improve on the curriculum as 
                the textbooks changed and new teaching materials became available. Using what I have learned, 
                I have been able to used these skills to teach fellow coworkers on different occasions.
