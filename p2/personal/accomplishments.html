            <h2>An Experienced Technician</h2>
            <p>For over thirty years I have worked with this company as a field service technician. 
                During that time, I have experienced many different situations and difficulties. 
                With teamwork and training I have met these challenges successfully. Using provided 
                tools and training, along with personal skills, I have been able to service a multitude of equipment
                 and customers.</p> 

                <p>I have been to several training classes from different manufacturers. Classes included
                    training on UPS systems, batteries, rectifier systems, and lighting inverters. I put
                    forth a lot of effort in these training opportunities.  Once, after completing a class,
                     a fellow classmate shook my hand and said, "I learned a lot just from you being in this class."
